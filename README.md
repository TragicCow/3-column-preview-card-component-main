## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was the first time I used media queries but I think there was better ways to handle the issue (rounding borders of the elements according to the size of the screen). 
I'll definitely check out other solutions to find a better way to do this.
